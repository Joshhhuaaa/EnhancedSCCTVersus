# Enhanced SCCT Versus Patch Notes

Thanks to AllyPal for contributing to various fixes and improvements in this version of Enhanced SCCT Versus with the [SCCT Versus Reloaded](https://allypal.github.io/SCCT_Versus_Reloaded) patch.

### Gameplay
- Grenades fired from a weapon will no longer sometimes explode instantly on impact, often called insta grenades, instead of waiting for their usual detonation time.
- Spies with adrenaline will no longer have stutter movement as clients.
- Spies no longer faintly appear in EMF Vision, often called EMF ghosting, when not using any equipment.
- Sticky Cam context menu that is used when a previous camera is active will no longer interrupt shooting a new camera when moving forward or backward.
- Sticky Cam interaction radius has been increased to make it easier to pick up cameras without needing to be at a specific angle.
- Frag Grenades fired by Mercenaries while moving forward will no longer visually appear to fall at the Mercenary's feet on the client's screen when the host's frame rate is significantly higher.
- Scope sway in Mercenary Sniper Mode will no longer increase on higher frame rates.
- Weapon kick in Mercenary Sniper Mode will no longer change depending on mouse sensitivity.
- Screen shake will more closely maintain its original intensity on higher frame rates.
- The Spy foot climb animation will no longer fail at certain heights on higher frame rates.
- The Coop boost animation has been locked at frame rates above 60 to ensure the Spy does not fail to reach the ledge.
- Spies and Mercenaries no longer have inconsistent damage values depending on which side of the body was hit.
- Animated textures and shaders will maintain their original speed and won't run faster on higher frame rates.
- Improved Mercenary movement to prevent accidentally performing a Berserk if moving forward.
- Adjusted the Mercenary crosshair to align more closely with the center of the screen.
- Proxy Mines' minimum detected velocity (140) have been raised to the Xbox version's value (200). This eliminates a rare chance that causes Proxy Mines to explode even when sneaking.
- Presence Detectors will scan every 1 second instead of 3 second intervals. A sound is no longer played when the scan occurs.

### Audio

  - Using medical kits

### Miscellaneous
- New console commands have been added. Open the console with the Tilde (~) or Backtick (\`) key and type `help` to see the list of available commands. Press the Escape key to close the console.

  - Includes a LAN master server that will automatically find sessions hosted by others online.
  - UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) will automatically port forward when hosting a game session if enabled in your router. UPnP can be configured by editing `host_upnp` in `SCCT_Versus.config`
  - Port numbers can be configured by editing `client_port_query`, `host_port_game` and `host_port_query` in `SCCT_Versus.config.`
  - To connect directly to a specific IP address, configure their IP address and port (default: 8888) in the `serverList` entry of `SCCT_Versus.config`.
- Mouse input has been corrected to accurately read data at high polling rates, eliminating the need for 125 Hz polling rate.
- Mouse input no longer has negative acceleration.
- Mouse input has been improved for the Sticky Cam and Cam. Net. camera modes.
